# FIND MY SHERPA

This resource will be another resource Destiny 2 players can use to look for Sherpas to help them with raids, dungeons (and maybe in the future GMs and Trials Flawless Carries). This app will be built using ruby on rails with PostgreSQL.

- **Select a Project Idea of your own**.
- Have at _least_ 2 models (more if it makes sense)
  - Auth is a **requirement**
- Have full CRUD on at _least_ one of your models
- Be able to Add/Delete on any remaining models
- Have high quality code:
    - Follow accepted naming conventions
    - Consistent indentation
    - Well-structured and readable code
    - Semantic naming of variables, functions, CSS classes, etc.
    - Short and clear functions that _do one thing_
    - Efficient code - if you have your MVP, refactor
    - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code
- **Use one of these technology stacks**. You may choose which tech stack.
  - Full-Stack Rails App
  - Rails API with React Front-End
  - Express API with React Front-End
- Be deployed on Heroku or similar platform
- **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app**.
- Timeframe - One week
